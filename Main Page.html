            <h1>Hello, I am Benjamin Reeves</h1>
            <p>A bit about myself before you look around the website...</p>
            <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
            <p>I was born in the Kansas City, Kansas area but started moving around the country when I was 7, living in Tampa, Florida, Altus, Oklahoma, and now Northern Virginia, getting to experience the different cultures of each place. My academic career
                has always been advanced, starting when I took Algebra two years prior to when others took it and now I am getting my Associate's degree in Computer Science from the Northern Virginia Community College two years ahead of my peers as well.
                I have worked at a restaurant as a cook, host, and food runner, starting when I was 14. After working there, I worked at my high school as an IT specialist where I configured, managed, and distributed the 2000+ laptops that were to be
                given to all the high school students. My most recent job was as a data control officer for a company, SiteMetric, which kept track of construction workers for construction companies.
